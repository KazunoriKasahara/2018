<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>This course is the first of a two-quarter sequence for Ph.D. students in political political science introductory methods sequence.
Students are introduced to the full stack of skills needed to conduct modern social science data analysis including data visualization, data wrangling, programming for data analysis, reproducible research, probability and statistical inference, linear regression, and causal inference.
Students will learn these skills while applying it to their own research problem.
The objective of this course is to provide students with an hands-on introduction and overview of modern social science data analysis and a base skills to pursue further studies and research in quantitative methods.
The next course in the sequence, POLS 503, covers linear models and causal inference methods in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="course-goals-and-learning-learning-objectives">Course Goals and Learning Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>By the end of the course students will be able to</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete a research project demonstrating mastery of statistical data analysis from exploratory analysis to inference to modeling</li>
<li>Visualize data and statistical models using R</li>
<li>Import and clean tabular data for use in statistical analysis using R</li>
<li>Write clean, reusable, and reliable R code using current best practices</li>
<li>Produce reproducible research using literate programming (R Markdown), version control (git and GitHub), and current best practices</li>
<li>Explain the difference between descriptive, predictive, and causal stastical questions.</li>
<li>Explain the difference between estimation and hypothesis testing
that can be used to make causal claims from observational data, including</li>
<li>Conduct, interpret, and communicate results from  t-tests, $\chi^2$ tests, and linear regression.</li>
<li>Explain limitations of causal inference using observational data and methods for making causal inference with observational data: selection on observables, difference-in-difference, before-and-after, regression discontinuity.</li>
<li>Feel empowered working with data</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The course is suitable for students with a large range of prior exposure to statistics and mathematics. No prior statistical, mathematical, or programming experience is necessary beyond arithmetic, algebra, and elementary calculus.<br />
Since the background of students taking this course is heterogeneous, the topics and structure of the course is such that those with a wide background of technical skills are likely to find something useful in it.</p>

<h1 id="assignments-and-course-activities">Assignments and Course Activities</h1>

<p>There are three main types of assignments for students</p>

<ol>
<li>Weekly homework: Learning data analysis requires practice. There will be weekly homework assignments. See the <a href="/assignments">assignments</a> page.</li>
<li>Research project: Students will complete a research project. The expectation is that students will work on the project throughout the quarter and apply concepts and skills to that project soon after covering them in class. See the <a href="/project">project</a> page for more details.</li>
<li>Reading Assignments: Students are expected to come to class prepared. I have chosen textbooks that are accessible, so we will not spend valuable class time summarizing assigned readings. Instead we will use class for more value-added learning activities. As part of that, before each class students will provide feedback and questions on the readings that will be used to guide class in-class discussion.</li>
</ol>

### Data analysis project paper

Every student in this class will execute their own statistical data analysis of a research question.
The results of this analysis will be presented as a paper due at the end of the course. See the [schedule](/schedule/#finals-period) for the due date.

The purpose of this paper is for you to apply the quantitative methods used in this course to the real-world research problems that you will encounter in their research careers.
The objective is to get you working with data on a research project as quickly as possible, even if it is a flawed project.
So, due to the limited time in this course, it is not necessary for this paper to address an important research problem or a novel contribution to the literature.
While those will not be criteria for the evaluation of this paper, you are encouraged to pursue those, as those ideas are what lead to publications.
The paper will be evaluated on the appropriateness of the statistical methods applied to the data and question, and not the novelty or contribution of the question itself.

If you developed a research design for POLS 500, you may be able to use it in 501.
However you need to confirm that you will be able to assemble a dataset to test a specific research hypothesis within the time constraints of this course, because you will be using it throughout the course.
If that seems unlikely, you will need to choose a different project.

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>Students will be evaluated on the whole of their work in this course.</p>

<p>For this course, grades on the 4.0 scale have the following interpretation:</p>

<table class = "table table-striped">
<tr><td>4.0</td><td>Exceptional</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.9</td><td>Very good</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.8</td><td>Meeting expectations</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.7</td><td>Somewhat below average</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.6</td><td>Not up to expectations</td></tr>
<tr><td>&le; 3.5</td><td>Way below expectations</td></tr>

<h1 id="materials">Materials</h1>

<h2 id="computational-tools">Computational Tools</h2>

<p>This course will use <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. We will also use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, which is an easy-to-use interface to R.
Instructions to install or upgrade R are <a href="install.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Students should have a laptop that they can bring to both class and lab as we will integrate computing with learning data analysis and statistics throughout the course.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>This course will primarily rely on the following texts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imai, Kosuke. 2017. <em>A First Course in Quantitative Social Science.</em> Princeton University Press.</li>
<li>Wickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. 2016. <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>. O&rsquo;Reilly Media. (free for everyone online)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, these text are supplemented by</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jrnold.github.io/qss-tidy/">QSS Tidyverse Code</a>. This course will use a set of R packages known as the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>. This provides tidyverse code equivalent to that in the <em>QSS</em> text.</li>
<li><a href="https://jrnold.github.io/e4qf/">R for Data Science Solutions</a>, to help you when working through <em>R for Data Science</em> solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be some additional readings as indicated in the <a href="/schedule">schedule</a>.</p>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

<p>Beyond what the teaching team can providing, there are several resources on campus that you can go for assistance with data, computing, and statistical problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Center for Social Science Computing and Research (<a href="http://julius.csscr.washington.edu/about/consulting.html">CSSCR</a>) has a drop-in statistical consulting center in Savery 119. They provide consulting on statistical software, e.g. R. Go there for software or data related questions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.csss.washington.edu/consulting">CSSS Statistical Consulting</a> provides general statistical consulting. Go there for questions about statistical methods.</li>
