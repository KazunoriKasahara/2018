## Overview

This course is the first of a two-quarter sequence for Ph.D. students in political political science introductory methods sequence. 
Students are introduced to the full stack of skills needed to conduct modern social science data analysis including data visualization, data wrangling, programming for data analysis, reproducible research, probability and statistical inference, linear regression, and causal inference.
Students will learn these skills while applying it to their own research problem.
The objective of this course is to provide students with an hands-on introduction and overview of modern social science data analysis and a base skills to pursue further studies and research in quantitative methods.
The next course in the sequence, POLS 503, covers linear models and causal inference methods in more detail.


### Course Goals

By the end of the course students will be able to 

1. Complete a research project demonstrating mastery of statistical data analysis from exploratory analysis to inference to modeling
1. Visualize data and statistical models using R
2. Import and clean tabular data for use in statistical analysis using R
3. Write clean, reusable, and reliable R code using current best practices
4. Produce reproducible research using literate programming (R Markdown), version control (git and GitHub), and current best practices
5. Explain the difference between descriptive, predictive, and causal stastical questions.
7. Explain the difference between estimation and hypothesis testing
that can be used to make causal claims from observational data, including 
8. Conduct, interpret, and communicate results from  t-tests, `$\chi^2$` tests, and linear regression.
7. Explain limitations of causal inference using observational data and methods for making causal inference with observational data: selection on observables, difference-in-difference, before-and-after, regression discontinuity.
10. Feel empowered working with data


### Prerequisites

<!--
The most important prerequisite is a willingness to work hard on possibly unfamiliar material.
Learning statistical methods is like learning a new language, and it will take time and dedication to master its vocabulary, its grammar, and its idioms. However like studying languages, statistics yields to daily practice and consistent effort. And statistical program is similar.
-->

The course is suitable for students with a large range of prior exposure to statistics and mathematics. No prior statistical, mathematical, or programming experience is necessary beyond arithmetic, algebra, and elementary calculus.  
Since the background of students taking this course is heterogeneous, the topics and structure of the course is such that those with a wide background of technical skills are likely to find something useful in it.

## Assignments

There are three main types of assignments for students

1. Weekly homework: Learning data analysis requires practice. There will be weekly homework assignments. See the [assignments](/assignments) page.
2. Research project: Students will complete a research project. The expectation is that students will work on the project throughout the quarter and apply concepts and skills to that project soon after covering them in class. See the [project](/project) page for more details.
3. Reading Assignments: Students are expected to come to class prepared. I have chosen textbooks that are accessible, so we will not spend valuable class time summarizing assigned readings. Instead we will use class for more value-added learning activities. As part of that, before each class students will provide feedback and questions on the readings that will be used to guide class in-class discussion.

### Data analysis project paper
legends o
Every student in this class will execute their own statistical data analysis of a research question.
The results of this analysis will be presented as a paper due at the end of the course. See the [schedule](/schedule/#finals-period) for the due date.

The purpose of this paper is for you to apply the quantitative methods used in this course to the real-world research problems that you will encounter in their research careers.
The objective is to get you working with data on a research project as quickly as possible, even if it is a flawed project.
So, due to the limited time in this course, it is not necessary for this paper to address an important research problem or a novel contribution to the literature.
While those will not be criteria for the evaluation of this paper, you are encouraged to pursue those, as those ideas are what lead to publications.
The paper will be evaluated on the appropriateness of the statistical methods applied to the data and question, and not the novelty or contribution of the question itself.

If you developed a research design for POLS 500, you may be able to use it in 501.
However you need to confirm that you will be able to assemble a dataset to test a specific research hypothesis within the time constraints of this course, because you will be using it throughout the course.
If that seems unlikely, you will need to choose a different project.

## Materials


### Computational Tools

This course will use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. We will also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an easy-to-use interface to R.
Instructions to install or upgrade R are [here](install.html).

Students should have a laptop that they can bring to both class and lab as we will integrate computing with learning data analysis and statistics throughout the course.

Students will have access to [DataCamp classroom](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education).
You can use this for additional practice. 



### Books

This course will primarily rely on the following texts:

- Imai, Kosuke. 2017. *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction.* Princeton University Press.
- Wickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. 2016. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). O'Reilly Media. (free online)

*Quantitative Social Science* (*QSS*) will provide the outline of the statistical topics that we will cover. 
*R for Data Science* (*R4DS*) covers R programming for data visualization and wrangling.

Additionally, these texts are supplemented by the following:

- [QSS Tidyverse Code](https://jrnold.github.io/qss-tidy/). *R4DS* and this course will use a set of R packages known as the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). However, *QSS* does not. This course supplements *QSS* with *tidyverse*.
- [R for Data Science Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/e4qf/), to help you when working through *R for Data Science* solutions.

There will be some additional readings as indicated in the [schedule](/schedule).



## Evaluation

Students will be evaluated on the whole of their work in this course.

For this course, grades on the 4.0 scale have the following interpretation:

<table class = "table table-striped">
<tr><td>4.0</td><td>Exceptional</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.9</td><td>Very good</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.8</td><td>Meeting expectations</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.7</td><td>Somewhat below average</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.6</td><td>Not up to expectations</td></tr>
<tr><td>&le; 3.5</td><td>Way below expectations</td></tr>
</table>


## Communication

We know that statistics can be challenging and help is available when you need it. We have made
every effort to give you the tools you need to succeed in this course. Ultimately though it is your
responsibility o put in the effort and seek out that help.
First, the readings provide ample sources of information and the suggested reading list contains
many versions of the same material but presented from a different angle. Precept material and
lecture slides will all be posted on Blackboard and can then be referenced.
For questions about the material and problem sets we will be using Piazza. You will not be
required to post, but the system is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently from classmates,
the preceptors, and the professor. Unless the question is of a personal nature or completely
specific to you, you should not e-mail teaching staff; instead, you should post your questions
on Piazza. The course staff will be monitoring the page, but we encourage you to help your
classmates as well. I will post the link to the course page here at the start of class
The preceptors and the instructor will hold office hours each week
